# Compiler Project

Contains a reference implementation for the Java-- compiler project.

# Optimizations 
We did all suggested optimizations, including constant Propagation and Folding, and Register Allocation, following the specification details. In jasmin we did so as well.

# Additional features
- Although our group is comprised of 2 members, we implemented the entire compiler as requested of groups of 3.
- Our compiler supports arrays of any type, including imported types.
- Our compiler allows for static and void functions other than main.
